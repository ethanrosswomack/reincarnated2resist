## Session Transcript (abbreviated)

- User: Can you write out each file and path and public url for me in a new .md file for safe keeping - then can we make an index.html for https://s3.omniversalaether.app as a homepage landing directory of bucket files - then we can set up that neon db with the correct urls? ...
- Copilot: I'll create two files: a safe-kept markdown file that lists important files/paths/URLs for the HAWK-ARS-00 bucket, and a simple `index.html` that can serve as a landing directory pointing to those public URLs. ...
- ...
- User: yes can you get started doing all you listed? Then can I just give you the credentials or you need me to input them? ...
- Copilot: I'll create migration SQL, CSV normalization and import helper scripts, a DB test script, and a README—all to prepare for running the Neon migration and CSV imports. ...
- ...
- User: can you push this all to github and the whole vscode experience here into a gh codespace I can work on this from a diff machine maybe? save these chat logs too? ...
