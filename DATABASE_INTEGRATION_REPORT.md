## üîÑ Next Steps to Complete Your Site

### Option 1: Provide Media URLs
Send me a list or spreadsheet with:
1. Album ID ‚Üí Cover Image URL
2. Track ID/Name ‚Üí Audio URL
3. Track ID/Name ‚Üí Video URL (if available)
4. Merch SKU ‚Üí Product Image URL

I'll update the database with the real URLs.

### Option 2: Upload Files to Replit
If you have the actual files (MP3s, images), you can:
1. Upload them to the Replit project
2. I'll create proper file serving routes
3. Update database URLs to point to local files

### Option 3: Keep Placeholders for Now
The site works with placeholder images. You can:
