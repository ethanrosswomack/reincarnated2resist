Iâ€™m hacking the matrix with my stainless
Iâ€™m dangerous
An insane whiz with languages
I came here to change shit
This world ainâ€™t ready but I wonâ€™t leave â€™em brainless
All these kids need guidance
No more deadheads with petty excuses for abuses
I let loose and it gets crucial

Such a nuisance
My conclusive intervention is so intrusive
All these pedophiles get lucid
They make plans to really do this
Leave me dead for what I said
Now listen to this fucking music

Iâ€™m not a slave
Iâ€™m unafraid
And I can never be contained
Hear what Iâ€™m saying
This whole game is not even worth playing
Theyâ€™ve got an issue
Hereâ€™s a tissue
Then Iâ€™ll send a fucking missile
Blow the whistle like Iâ€™m Cooper
This epistleâ€™s detrimental
Shock the system when you listen

Read a book about these crooks
Iâ€™m on a mission
Pay attention
Using dragonâ€™s fire
Cook these dark bitches
Leave â€™em shook
Because they thought Marina had me spooked

But tell them bitches and the devil I said not to look
Iâ€™m not playing
Iâ€™ll keep spraying with these word games
Keep conveying everything thatâ€™s off the record

Wreck the pyramids
Detect â€™em then dissect â€™em
Resurrect men who died trying to inspect â€˜em
Yeah the Illuminati puppets never suspected Iâ€™d infect â€˜em
But I am here and this is real
I think itâ€™s time to make â€™em feel

Too afraid to not reveal what they keep hid behind the veil
Of deception like Inception
No conjectures in this lecture
Just a soul thatâ€™s much too old to ever let this shit continue

I am peeling back the layers
More than just a rhyme-sayer
I am like a lethal injection
And this infectious prayer of mine can really slay â€™em

Creeping in with grenades
I napalm their greatest plans
Like Iâ€™m back in Vietnam
Put the brainchild to rest
They cannot test me
Iâ€™m the best
Wild West

Donâ€™t second guess
These lyrical bullets will go directly through your vest
Iâ€™ll pierce your heart inside your chest
Just a needle
Shit so evil
Even Satan wouldnâ€™t wish to go against me by himself
He would need every selfish elf to team up and try to help

I flick my wrist
They lose themselves
Hypnotize â€˜em with this rhyming soliloquy of mine
Theyâ€™d all die and Iâ€™d be fine
Plus this killer teamâ€™s divine

I got a legion at my side and an army at my rear
A fucking stampedeâ€™s enough just to crush â€˜em
Theyâ€™re too scared
Anonymously assembled
At the ready
Donâ€™t you dare me
I could take you all myself
But I doubt they would let you near me

Full disclosureâ€™s what Iâ€™m seeking
Iâ€™m not rapping
Bitch
Iâ€™m preaching

If you want it you can get it
Just like the demons and the deacons
Take your soul
Cunt
And keep it
Iâ€™m too blunt
And yes I mean it

I move carefully
Donâ€™t scare easy
Not squeamish and so sleazy
Youâ€™ll swear that Iâ€™m the shit
Cannot fake it
Too legit
I told you bitches Iâ€™d be back
So just listen as I spit

Saying words so absurd
Using all these poison verbs
To keep you hanging on each word
And make you taste it
Bite my germs
```
