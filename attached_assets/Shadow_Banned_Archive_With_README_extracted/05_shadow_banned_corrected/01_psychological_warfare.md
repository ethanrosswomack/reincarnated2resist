This is psychological warfare, so deep  
They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak  
But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep  
Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see

This is psychological warfare, so deep  
They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak  
But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep  
Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see

They better  
Shadow Ban me  

I'm the shadow banned rapper back to fracture the scene  
And fucking crack the foundations these Masons believed  
Would hold forever - I will sever every god damned string  
Attached to you fuckin puppets - Now you're stuck with me  

And you can't silence or quiet this fucking riot  
These violent men and women that I've incited  
Won't comply with you tyrants  
No they don't buy it - That's why I am still trying to be  
Loud enough to keep you dumb cunts quiet, you see  

Cause when I came to invade  
And make you bitches behave  
I wasn't asking for permission  
Okay listen - A slave  
Is someone you control with whips  
And hit with shit just to get  
Their brothers to submit  
But hypnotists witness this  

I enlisted to persist - so fuck with me and you'll wish  
That my relentless intervention didn't even exist  
Cause I'm here to lead the resistance  
And make you bleed - Murder business  
Is what you see within these trenches  
But if you need my assistance  
I will keep popping up everywhere  
You can't stop me and never will  

It's impossible - Apocalyptic gospels with very clear  
Messages are heard regardless of any attempt  
To prevent the lyrics sent from Heaven through these lips  
From being slipped in the script then broadcasted legitimately  

I'll get the whole fucking network to quit  
Cause my assault on this system is an awful addition  
When my tongue becomes the gun that's going off in this prison  
It gets all the attention - That's what you call wicked wisdom  
Intended military confrontation solved with precision  
You lost the war at the start - I came to tear you apart  
You think you're more than capable of taking me, but you aren't  

This is psychological warfare, so deep  
They kill any motherfucker who dares to speak  
But I'm not like the others that you shot, cause I keep  
Fuckin' telling you freaks, you can't stop me, see

> Lyrical Dissection & Commentary  
> Track: Psychological Warfare — Shadow Banned 2024

This opening salvo of *Shadow Banned* establishes Hawk Eye not just as a rapper — but as a defiant insurgent embedded in the matrix of controlled narratives. “Psychological Warfare” is more than a track title — it’s a **declaration of intent**.  

Lyrically, the cadence rides militant, prophetic, and disruptive. The repetition of “you can’t stop me” functions as both a warning and a **spiritual reinforcement loop** — incantatory, tactical, insurgent.

Behind the aggression lies purpose: the idea that lyrical power can outmaneuver institutional censorship, shadow banning, and information warfare. This track is a resistance blueprint — **coded, embedded, and broadcast through the language of fire**.
